This is just a basic Sencha Touch 2.0 skeleton app.  
It needs to be served by a webserver in order to render, and you need to use a webkit based browser (Safari, Chrome, iPhone/Android).  

If you have problems with it getting stuck on the loading page, try navigating to /calcapp/ or /calcapp/index.html explicitly instead of just to /calcapp
